# Merge sort is defined as a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, 
# sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.

# In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, 
# and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

# Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided 
# i.e., the array has only one element left (an array with one element is always sorted). Then the sorted subarrays are merged 
# into one sorted array.

# T(n) = Î¸(Nlog(N))  - The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm in the average case.
# S(n) = O(N)        - The space complexity of the merge sort
