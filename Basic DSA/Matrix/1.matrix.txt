A matrix is a two-dimensional array that consists of rows and columns. 
It is an arrangement of elements in horizontal or vertical lines of entries.

Declaration of Matrix or Grid
The syntax of declaring a Matrix or two-dimensional array is very much similar to that of a one-dimensional array, given as follows.

"int arr[number_of_rows][number_of_columns]; " 
- This statement declares a variable named 'arr' which can hold the number of rows and columns.



How to access data in Matrix or Grid
Like one-dimensional arrays, matrices can be accessed randomly by using their indices to access the individual elements. 
A cell has two indices, one for its row number, and the other for its column number. We can use X[i][j] to access the element 
which is at the ith row and jth column of the matrix.
