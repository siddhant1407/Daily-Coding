# Given a 2D square matrix, print the Principal and Secondary diagonals.

# Input: 
# 1 2 3 4
# 4 3 2 1
# 7 8 9 6
# 6 5 4 3
# Output:
# Principal Diagonal: 1, 3, 9, 3
# Secondary Diagonal: 4, 2, 8, 6

# 1) The primary diagonal is formed by the elements A00, A11, A22, A33.
# Condition for Principal Diagonal: The row-column condition is row = column.

# 2) The secondary diagonal is formed by the elements A03, A12, A21, A30. 
# Condition for Secondary Diagonal: The row-column condition is row = numberOfRows â€“ column -1.
